## 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- **Git**: Version control system to clone repositories.
- **Flutter SDK**: The main tool for Flutter development.
- **Flutter-compatible IDE**: Options include Android Studio with the Flutter plugin, Visual Studio Code with the Flutter extension, or any other editor of your choice.
- **Dart SDK**: Dart is the programming language used for Flutter development.

## 2. Setting Up Development Environment
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Install Git
Download and install Git for your operating system from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Install Flutter SDK
1. Download the Flutter SDK for your operating system from the [official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a location on your system.
3. Add the Flutter `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

### Install Dart SDK
Flutter comes with the Dart SDK, so you don't need to install it separately.

### Install a Flutter-Compatible IDE
Choose one of the following IDEs to work with Flutter:
- **Android Studio**: Download and install Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio). Install the Flutter plugin from the IDE's plugin marketplace.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com). Install the Flutter extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

## 3. Cloning the Fines App Repository
To work on the Fines App project, follow these steps to clone its repository:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Fines App repository using the `cd` command.
3. Clone the repository using the following command:
   
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:officialpuretalent/finesapp.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the cloned repository directory using `cd finesapp`.

## 4. Restoring Pub Packages
The Fines App uses external packages managed by `pub`, the package manager for Dart. To restore the packages:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository if you're not already there.
2. Run the following command to restore the packages:

   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

Flutter will read the `pubspec.yaml` file and download the required packages.
