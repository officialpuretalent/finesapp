## 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- **Git**: Version control system to clone repositories.
- **Flutter SDK**: The main tool for Flutter development.
- **Flutter-compatible IDE**: Options include Android Studio with the Flutter plugin, Visual Studio Code with the Flutter extension, or any other editor of your choice.
- **Dart SDK**: Dart is the programming language used for Flutter development.

## 2. Setting Up Development Environment
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Install Git
Download and install Git for your operating system from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Install Flutter SDK
1. Download the Flutter SDK for your operating system from the [official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a location on your system.
3. Add the Flutter `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

### Install Dart SDK
Flutter comes with the Dart SDK, so you don't need to install it separately.

### Install a Flutter-Compatible IDE
Choose one of the following IDEs to work with Flutter:
- **Android Studio**: Download and install Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio). Install the Flutter plugin from the IDE's plugin marketplace.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com). Install the Flutter extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

## 3. Cloning the Fines App Repository
To work on the Fines App project, follow these steps to clone its repository:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Fines App repository using the `cd` command.
3. Clone the repository using the following command:
   
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:officialpuretalent/finesapp.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the cloned repository directory using `cd finesapp`.

## 4. Restoring Pub Packages
The Fines App uses external packages managed by `pub`, the package manager for Dart. To restore the packages:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository if you're not already there.
2. Run the following command to restore the packages:

   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

Flutter will read the `pubspec.yaml` file and download the required packages.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your Flutter development environment for the Fines App, cloned the repository, and restored the necessary package dependencies. You're now ready to dive into developing the Fines App. Remember to consult the app's specific documentation for any additional setup or guidelines. Happy coding! ðŸš€
